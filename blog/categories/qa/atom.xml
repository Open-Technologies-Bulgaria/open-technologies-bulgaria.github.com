    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've got my hands onto a <code>ThinkPad Mini Dock Series 3</code> docking station which is
compatible with my newest laptop. Being a QA engineer for so long I immediately
noticed something that wasn't quite right. The buttons on the left and the mechanism
next to them are blocking the hot air exhaust from the CPU fan. This model of docking
station is made to fit several models of laptops and those which dock in position 2 are
less affected from those which dock in possition 1. Mine was not a lucky one.</p>

<p>On the pictures below it is clearly visible that most of the hot air coming out of the CPU
fan is blocked.</p>

<p>In order to reduce laptop heating and provide better cooling I decided to remove the
1/2 position switch mechanism. To do that you have to unscrew all screws from the docking
station and carefully split the top and bottom halves. The offending piece of plastic is
screwed with two tiny screws at the bottom. Once they are removed everything comes off.</p>

<p>Because QA is not only about finding bugs but making sure people are aware of them so bugs
get fixed I've sent an email to <code>Lenovo</code>. I'd be glad if they take this into account and
do a better test job for their next models. I don't want to switch to another laptop brand :(.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> <a href="http://www.opencode.com/">Opencode Systems</a></p>

<p><strong>Industry:</strong> Telecommunications</p>

<p><strong>Geography:</strong> Bulgaria/International</p>

<p><strong>Business challenge:</strong> Improve existing QA infrastructure and processes</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Deploy QA lab and test automation framework, consulting, training</p>

<p><strong>Software:</strong> <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/beaker/">Beaker</a> automated testing framework</p>

<p><strong>Hardware:</strong> HP blade servers</p>

<p><strong>Migration:</strong> no</p>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Faster QA turnaround, better test coverage</p>

<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>

<p>Opencode Systems is a telecommunications solution provider, dedicated to open systems for the mobile network.
Opencode makes network technology that is invisible to consumers but underlies many of the mobile services they use.</p>

<p>Opencode is the industry’s number one provider of USSD Center and CAMEL Gateway which have become the operators’ choice for open network platforms.</p>

<p>Opencode SS7/SIGTRAN network centered solutions have been deployed by Tier 1 mobile operators worldwide.</p>

<h2>BUSINESS CHALLENGE</h2>

<p>Opencode Systems\' solutions integrate specific hardware and software which runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
The company wanted to improve its QA operations and deploy new test lab, complete with systems provisioning
and test automation which is native to Linux. Opencode also wanted to re-organize their development process
and follow more closely software packaging best practices for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>

<h2>SOLUTION</h2>

<p>Open Technologies Bulgaria was hired to evaluate the existing infrastructure and work-flows and provide
recommendations for improvements as well as implement the selected solution. After meeting with Opencode\'s
key QA and development engineers we created a report to present to higher management.</p>

<p><em>Beaker</em> test automation framework was selected because it matched all existing and future requirements of the
company and integrates very well with Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Beaker was deployed onto completely new
hardware inside the company\'s data canter and employees were trained how to use it, write automated test scripts
and how to schedule test jobs.</p>

<p>In addition Open Technologies Bulgaria helped with recommendations for hiring new QA staff.</p>

<h2>BENEFITS</h2>

<p>The new test lab allows the company to increase test coverage and provide better software to their customers.
Automation shortens test turnaround time and allows more flexibility on how and when testing is performed.</p>

<p>Improvement recommendations revealed work-flows which were not functioning smoothly. Implementing them in the long term
will provide additional benefits to Opencode.</p>
