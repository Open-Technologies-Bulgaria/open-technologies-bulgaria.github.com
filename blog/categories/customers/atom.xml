<p><strong>Customer: </strong> <a href="http://elsys-bg.org">Technological School "Electronic Systems"</a></p>

<p><strong>Industry: </strong> Education</p>

<p><strong>Geography: </strong> Sofia, Bulgaria</p>

<p><strong>Business challenge:</strong> cheap and efficient equipment of new computer room</p>

<p><strong>Solution: </strong> Deployment of multi-seat environment</p>

<p><strong>Software: </strong> Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Workstation, multi-seat add-ons</p>

<p><strong>Hardware: </strong> <a href="http://ts.fujitsu.com/products/standard_servers/tower/primergy_tx100s1.html">Fujitsu TX100 S1</a> server,
<a href="http://plugable.com/products/UGA-125/">Plugable UGA-125</a> USB video, USB peripherals</p>

<p><strong>Migration: </strong> none</p>

<p><strong>Advantages: </strong> low cost, low maintenance</p>

<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>

<p>Technological School "Electronic Systems" at the Technical University - Sofia is unique in Bulgaria.
ElSys offers the best education in information technology. The school has modern computer laboratories and excellent teachers.
The school prepares specialists in the professional fields of "Automation and Electronics",
"Programming" and "Computer Networks". The school has a local Cisco Academy.</p>

<h2>BUSINESS CHALLENGE</h2>

<p>The main challenge for ElSys was furnishing a new computer lab at minimal cost using existing peripheral hardware.
The second challenge was to use a platform that is familiar to students and which requires minimal maintenance.</p>

<h2>SOLUTION</h2>

<p>Multi-seat environment SUMU was preferred because of its innovative technology, ease of use and low cost of electricity.</p>

<h2>BENEFITS</h2>

<p>Entire classroom with 15 seats was equipped with a single powerful server. As a result dramatically reduced noise pollution and heat,
electricity costs and freed up more space on each table.</p>

<p>Together we built a low voltage USB network, removing the old high-voltage AC cables which were unsafe.
The room became safer and more spacious.</p>

<p>The absence of additional computers shortens the time needed to update software, install new programs and configure settings
while leaving more time for system administrators to work on other projects in the school.</p>

<p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 includes a variety of environments and programming languages which are used in specialized classes.
Students in the school have experience with Linux and working with the new system was not a problem for them.</p>

<p>Photos of the testing process and use of the new class room can be found at

<p><strong>Migration:</strong> no</p>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Dynamic use of IT resources, fast product development</p>

<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>

<p>DCH LLC is a young Bulgarian company, which offers financial risk management software.
The focus of the company is to assess liquidity risk for international customers.</p>

<p>Software solutions of DCH LLC are developed on Linux and partnering with the leading open source provider - Red Hat - was an obvious next step.</p>

<h2>BUSINESS CHALLENGE</h2>

<p>The main business challenges of the company was building a computing infrastructure that will be used for development, testing and demonstration of their software solutions
and creating partnerships in the Linux field.</p>

<h2>SOLUTION</h2>

<p>Open Technologies Bulgaria was selected to implement the necessary infrastructure and provide advisory services on a partnership with Red Hat.</p>

<p>Implemented infrastructure is a farm of virtual machines. It includes instances for development and testing,
source code repository server, demonstration server, database and others. All virtual machines are installed with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6,
which is the main platform for development of the company products.</p>

<p>DCH LLC sought our consulting services to gain a better understanding of different types of Red Hat affiliate programs and the advantages thereof.
As a result, the company chose to apply for an independent software vendor partnership.</p>

<h2>BENEFITS</h2>

<p>Implemented infrastructure of virtual machines allows the company to quickly and easily experiment with new versions and technologies
in order to offer attractive solutions to its customers. Completely virtual environment allows better use of resources and allows dynamics in their distribution,
thereby reducing the operating costs of the company.</p>

<p>DCH's partnership with Red Hat provides the company access to a stable Linux platform and guaranteed technical support.
The company can focus its resources on developing its core products rather than to continuously monitor changes in Linux distributions
and deal with compatibility problems. This avoids the waste of staff and excess labor, which is useful for the company and its customers.</p>

<p>DCH extended its market visibility, because many of the financial institutions use Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
This way, DCH offers a solution that is ready for use.</p>

<p><strong>Industry:</strong> Accounting Services</p>

<p><strong>Geography:</strong> Bulgaria</p>

<p><strong>Business challenge:</strong> Reliable solution for file storage</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Build internal corporate file server</p>

<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>

<p>Vidiko Ltd. offers accounting services.</p>

<h2>BUSINESS CHALLENGE</h2>

<p>The key business challenge for the company was to provide a reliable file server for internal use.
Access to files should be possible from Windows desktop stations that used to work with specialized software.</p>

<h2>SOLUTION</h2>

<p>Open Technologies Bulgaria has built a file server using four disk RAID10 array combined with LVM.
The machine is installed with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Server, and access from Windows stations is through Samba.
Additional UPS provides power failure protection.</p>

<h2>BENEFITS</h2>

<p>RAID10 configuration protects against disk failure and loss of information while improving productivity.
Combined with the standard Linux LVM (logical volume manager), the server capacity can be expanded in the future by adding additional hard drives.</p>

<p>UPS provides protection from power blackouts and voltage differences.
The server is configured to automatically switch on and off in the presence of power or low battery.
This eliminated the need for constant monitoring by company staff.</p>
