BACKGROUND
----------
Vidiko Ltd. offers accounting services.

BUSINESS CHALLENGE
------------------

The key business challenge for the company was to provide a reliable file server for internal use.
Access to files should be possible from Windows desktop stations that used to work with specialized software.

SOLUTION
--------

Open Technologies Bulgaria has built a file server using four disk RAID10 array combined with LVM.
The machine is installed with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Server, and access from Windows stations is through Samba.
Additional UPS provides power failure protection.

BENEFITS
--------

RAID10 configuration protects against disk failure and loss of information while improving productivity.
Combined with the standard Linux LVM (logical volume manager), the server capacity can be expanded in the future by adding additional hard drives.

UPS provides protection from power blackouts and voltage differences.
The server is configured to automatically switch on and off in the presence of power or low battery.
This eliminated the need for constant monitoring by company staff.
