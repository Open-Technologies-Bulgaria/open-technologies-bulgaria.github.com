BACKGROUND
----------

BebeKarta is a website for mothers to exchange or re-sell used and new kid items. It can also be
used from merchants to promote new articles to their target audience.

BUSINESS CHALLENGE
------------------

To create easy to use and maintain website with free/paid subscriptions and integration into SMS
payment gateway.

SOLUTION
--------

Open Technologies Bulgaria was selected to develop a Drupal based website which integrates a good
amount of standard Drupal modules. During the development process we had to adjust some modules to
avoid bugs or unwanted functionality. We developed additional modules to integrate with SMS payment
gateway [Mobio](http://mobio.bg) and allow for content expiration based on subscriptions.

Graphic design is made by <a href="http://www.novsait.eu">Georgi Atanasov</a>.

BENEFITS

Flexible website which is easy to use and doesn't require technical expertise to maintain.
