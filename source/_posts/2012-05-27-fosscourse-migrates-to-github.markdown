BACKGROUND
----------

fosscourse is an independent project which seeks to introduce formal open source training
into universities. It was founded and supported by [Bozhidar Batsov](http://github.com/bbatsov),
[Kiril Kamburov](http://github.com/kamburov) and [Alexander Todorov](http://github.com/atodorov).

The team delivered several semesters of trainings at the Technical University - Sofia during 2008-2009
and some sporadic events at Sofia University in 2010. Since then the project has been discontinued
and its domain and web hosting have expired.


BUSINESS CHALLENGE
------------------

To migrate existing content to a public archive which is free of charge and doesn't require any maintenance.


SOLUTION
--------

Open Technologies Bulgaria has been a backup of the project during all its years, providing technical
support and hosting when necessary. We've migrated all pages from the legacy MediaWiki into
a GitHub wiki. The migration was straight-forward with some minor issues. Unfortunately some of the original
MediaWiki pages were damaged repair and could not be migrated. We've kept a copy of the database should someone
decide to pickup and revive the project. 

BENEFITS
--------

Seamless migration from a legacy platform and public mirror of once active and vibrant project.
