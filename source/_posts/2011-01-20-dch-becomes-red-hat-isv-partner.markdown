BACKGROUND
----------

DCH LLC is a young Bulgarian company, which offers financial risk management software.
The focus of the company is to assess liquidity risk for international customers.

Software solutions of DCH LLC are developed on Linux and partnering with the leading open source provider - Red Hat - was an obvious next step.

BUSINESS CHALLENGE
------------------

The main business challenges of the company was building a computing infrastructure that will be used for development, testing and demonstration of their software solutions
and creating partnerships in the Linux field.

SOLUTION
--------

Open Technologies Bulgaria was selected to implement the necessary infrastructure and provide advisory services on a partnership with Red Hat.

Implemented infrastructure is a farm of virtual machines. It includes instances for development and testing,
source code repository server, demonstration server, database and others. All virtual machines are installed with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6,
which is the main platform for development of the company products.

DCH LLC sought our consulting services to gain a better understanding of different types of Red Hat affiliate programs and the advantages thereof.
As a result, the company chose to apply for an independent software vendor partnership.

BENEFITS
--------

Implemented infrastructure of virtual machines allows the company to quickly and easily experiment with new versions and technologies
in order to offer attractive solutions to its customers. Completely virtual environment allows better use of resources and allows dynamics in their distribution,
thereby reducing the operating costs of the company.

DCH's partnership with Red Hat provides the company access to a stable Linux platform and guaranteed technical support.
The company can focus its resources on developing its core products rather than to continuously monitor changes in Linux distributions
and deal with compatibility problems. This avoids the waste of staff and excess labor, which is useful for the company and its customers.

DCH extended its market visibility, because many of the financial institutions use Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
This way, DCH offers a solution that is ready for use.
